        <h2>School Trips</h2>

        <h3>Year 11 History Trip</h3>

        <p>Last week, Year 11 History students travelled to Arrowtown to gather resources for our History
            internals. On Wednesday, we went to Bendigo Goldfields and were provided with useful background
            information on the life of early miners and the dangers they faced. We visited the Goldfields
            Mining Centre, in the Kawarau Gorge. We all tried our hands at gold panning, although
            unfortunately nobody “struck it big”. Thursday was a busy and focused day for us, with access
            granted to the Lakes District Museum archives and a historical tour around Arrowtown, including
            the cemetery. Friday was spent visiting the Cromwell and Alexandra cemeteries and the Cromwell
            museum, to help with our internals. All the girls thoroughly enjoyed the trip and are grateful
            for the opportunities to explore Central Otago history. We would like to say a huge thanks to Mr
            Gibbs and Ms Reeves for driving the vans and putting up with us for three whole days, to the
            Dining Room staff for catering for us and to all the staff at Lakes District Museum, Goldfields
            Mining Centre and Cromwell Museum. Also, a massive thank you to Mrs Johnston for all the time
            and effort that went into organising this trip, as well as making sure it was enjoyable and
            informative.

            Year 12 Geography field trip to Aoraki Mt Cook:
            “Do something new, New Zealand” is something that we have heard a lot over the past 12 months
            since our borders have been closed due to Covid-19. Last week, the Year 12 Geography students
            were lucky enough to put this catch phrase into practise and get out and explore the beautiful
            Aoraki Mt Cook whilst of course working on internal, and external assessments. Over the two
            days, we conducted research on the vegetation in different areas of the National Park, saw the
            incredible Tasman Glacier from the Tasman Lake and put together smaller pictures of information
            we had learnt in class for everything to come together and make sense. We also had sessions with
            DOC to learn more about glaciation and their perspective on the controversial 1080. The Glacier
            Explorers boat trip to the glacier was definitely a highlight and although the weather was
            definitely not what we had hoped for, we all managed to have an amazing time and explore a new
            part of our country. We would love to say a massive thank you to Miss Gilbert and Miss Smillie
            for organising and facilitating the trip. Without your efforts, this trip wouldn’t have been
            possible.

        <h3>Year 12 Bio</h3>

        <p>
            Students from the Year 12 Biology classes gathering data on glacial moraines of the Mueller Glacier, at
            Aoraki/Mt Cook, last Wednesday. Weather conditions tested the students’ ability to record plant species in
            the field, with Alpine weather really demonstrating how volatile it could be. The students were recording
            data for the internal assessment on Identifying a Community Pattern they will be completing in the coming
            week.
