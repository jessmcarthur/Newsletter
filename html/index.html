            Ms Glenys Parry
            Former Head of Art at Craighead, and much respected friend and colleague, Ms Glenys Parry passed away
            peacefully on Monday following a lengthy battle with cancer.
            Glenys was passionate about Art, having studied at the University of Canterbury, majoring in Sculpture, then
            spending 5 years in Auckland making jewellery from her Auckland studio. She trained as a teacher at the
            Christchurch College of Education, then spent several years traveling through Africa, the Middle East and
            Europe. From there, she returned to teaching in Christchurch, eventually moving to teach at Craighead in
            1995.
            Ms Parry was an inspirational teacher - evidenced by the quality of Art produced by her Art students. Over
            the years, Craighead Art students achieved numerous Scholarships in Painting, Photography and Sculpture. Her
            students’ folios were often included in the Top Art roadshow, and they achieved many successes in local and
            regional Art competitions. Through Art, Ms Parry saw young people develop, drawing from their personal
            background and celebrating their cultural heritage. Ms Parry also believed that embracing visual
            communication in the digital age was essential and that student development benefitted from a holistic art
            education. In March 2018, Ms Parry was honoured to receive an ASG National Excellence in Teaching Award
            (NEiTA), one of six teachers from around New Zealand to take out a $5000 national teaching award. She was so
            deserving of this award for teaching excellence.
            What made Ms Parry a great teacher was her passion, her love of Art, her love of Art practice, and her love
            of creativity. She was kind, caring and collegial. We will miss her. Our thoughts and prayers go out the
            Parry and Armstrong families, especially her husband Michael and their two sons.

            Education Review Office Evaluation Partner
            Our ERO evaluation partner Mrs Shelley Wyllie conducted her initial visit on Monday of this week. The
            purpose of this meeting was to familiarise herself with the school and its context, and to meet the Chair of
            the Board of Trustees Mr Ant Ford, and the Senior Leadership team. She shared details of the new evaluation
            approach by the Education Review Office, in that a relationship is developed with the school over a longer
            time period, rather than an intense review over the space of one week, followed by a report. This time, we
            will agree upon a specific aspect of our strategic plan upon which to focus our evaluation (likely to be our
            Year 7-10 Curriculum), which will be adjusted to fit in with resource and time constraints. The next meeting
            is on the first day of Term 2, when we will identify existing internal evaluation capability in the school
            and reach agreement about a useful focus and scope for an evaluation based on our existing priorities.

            Wanaka Show weekend
            It is fortunate that the Wanaka Show is able to proceed as planned under Alert Level One. We will again have
            a presence there in our usual spot this Friday and Saturday as part of our regular marketing and promotions
            strategy. We do enjoy meeting up with Old Girls and prospective students and their families. Do pop in and
            visit the Craighead tent if you are coming to this fantastic show.

        <h2>Student Leader</h2>

        <p>
            Moving to Craighead from a small country school in Year 9 was a shocking and exciting experience. Though I
            feared that I would get mistaken for a Year 7 because of my height, I was eager to get involved with all the
            new opportunities that Craighead had to offer.
            Now, as a Year 13 student who still gets mistaken about my year group due to my height, I am thankful for
            all the experiences Craighead has given me over the years. These experiences have led me to where I am today
            and to have the privilege of being Head Boarder for 2021, alongside Pieta Prouting who has supported me
            right from the start, including one of our biggest Boarding House events, the boarders Weekend-In which was
            a great success with a lot of memories made. Being in the Boarding House has allowed me to enjoy my sports,
            make friendships for life and gain important skills that I can carry with me after I leave school.
            Highlights of my time at Craighead include the many school camps and trips, attending Maadi Cup at Lake
            Karapiro and making the Hanan Shield Rugby team and involvement with other sporting events and committees
            within the school and the wider community. These have allowed me to grow as a person and set goals for
            myself to strive for success.
            For 2022, I am hoping to further my study at Lincoln University within the Agriculture sector. Being from a
            family-owned farm and contracting business I have always had an interest in heavy machinery, cropping and
            livestock. I cannot wait to see what opportunities this year brings, but I will be sure to cherish the
            memories of my last year at Craighead with my "hostel rangers" by my side.
