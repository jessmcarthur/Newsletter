        <h3>Chapel</h3>

        <p>As we continue into Lent, we begin the week by exploring fasting. Has there ever been a time in your life
            that you have fasted from something? Why did you fast? During Lent we often fast from an item, or a practice
            so that we can draw closer to God.
            Towards the end of the week, we wonder what is meditation? Meditation through a Biblical lens is about
            filling our minds with God's words. Of reading a daily Psalm or engaging in a Bible App. Phillipians 4:8
            puts it: "Fix your thoughts on what is true and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable."
            DaVine Youth Group 6:30-8:30pm every Wednesday.

            The Female-only Defence Careers Experience (DCE) to be held at Burnham Military Camp on 28–30 April, is
